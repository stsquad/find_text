find_text - a simple text finder written in Python

This program is designed to extract text files from binary dumps (for example dd dumps).

It was written to recover a bunch of wiki text from a hard disk recovery. While tools
like scalpel, foremost and photorec are brilliant for retrieving structured data they suck
at plain text as there are no well formed headers to search for.

The program is very simple and fairly dumb and relies on files being sequential in the data dump.
